# Supermarket-Inventory-System

The project, "Supermarket Inventory System," aimed to develop a management system for a hypermarket, allowing users to add items, list current items, and perform various inventory-related tasks. The system utilized a text-based interface, with options to add items, list current items, view items with quantities less than 5, find items under a given price, check for expired items, and generate stock statistics. The project included features like item expiry, aisle number, and quantity management. The team used C++ programming language to implement the system, with data stored in a text file for persistence.
